# Immersing-Headphone-Device
## Main research content：
   Mixed reality encompasses a wide range of experiences that previously were considered to be only augmented reality or only virtual reality. Sound play a key role for a man to percept and interact with the virtual environment.
   In this project, we focus on virtual sound spatialization through headphones. We will begin to integrated the inertial information of one’s head, and transform the sound spatialization so to follow the head movement. We will try to develop a prototype based on inertial sensors, microprocessors and headphones.
## Innovation points and significance：
   The innovation points are the idea of developing a device purely for the immersing experience of sound . Because while there have been a lot of VR devices produced , there is no such device of pure sound experience .
   The significance of our project is that our project can use only an algorithm to achieve the immersing effect. Nowadays , the experience of immersion of sound in a VR device depends on the recording procedure . However , our project can achieve the same effect without recording the soundtrack , but just make an algorithm to conduct any kind of acoustic signal which has been recorded in a certain form already . This will add the universal application of this project and this is quite practical for media companies to give the audience a more advanced music immersing experience.
## Research schedule：
  Phase One : Thesis proposal . (Discussion with our supervisor professor Jialiang Lu)
  Phase Two : Research about the theory of dimensional stereo , the theory of the Binaural Effect .
  Phase Three : Give a basic model (algorithm) to achieve the conduct of sound theoretically.
  Phase Four : Learn and use Arduino to return the parameters of the turning angle of the audience .
  Phase Five : Learn the encode and decode procedure in the process of input and output a certain music of a certain form . 
## Final achievements expected
  The final achievements are expected to be the algorithm and an application of Android . First of all we expect to develop an application which can input audios , then conduct the audio and finally output it into a headphone device which can give the user an immersing experience horizontally . 
   For a more profound result , in the way of using Arduino or other kind of SCM (Single Chip Machine) , we want to wrap our algorithm into a small size of chip to make it portable . That means we can conduct and cope with the signal in a small size of device which can be integrated with the headphone without using the application of the audio player . This headphone will be exactly the product we expect . 
   Finally , if all these above are successfully realized , we then want to improve our algorithm and add one more dimension (vertical axis) to make the audio more dimensional .
