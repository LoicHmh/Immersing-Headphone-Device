# Immersing-Headphone-Device
## Main research content：
Our main research content is to find an algorithm of adjusting the original soundtrack of music to fabricate a type of headphone which can fix the sound field and give a fixed virtual space of sound in which the audience can have an immersing experience while listening to any type of music. The experience of immersion means that when the audience turn his or her head and change the direction of his or her face , the sound will move in the opposite direction so that the audience will have an experience like listening to the music in a display room.
## Innovation points and significance：
What is creative and new in our project is that , while there has been a lot of VR devices produced , there is no such device of pure sound experience . What is more , the experience of immersion of sound in a VR device depends on the recording procedure . However , our project can achieve the same effect without recording the soundtrack , but just make an algorithm to conduct any kind of acoustic signal which has been recorded in a certain form already . This will add the universal application of this project and this is quite practical for media companies to give the audience a more advanced music immersing experience.
## Research schedule：
  ### Phase One : Thesis proposal . (Discussion with our supervisor professor Jialiang Lu)
  ### Phase Two : Research about the theory of dimensional stereo , the theory of 
             the Binaural Effect .
  ### Phase Three : Give a basic model (algorithm) to achieve the conduct of sound
              theoretically.
  ### Phase Four : Learn and use Arduino to return the parameters of the turning angle
             of the audience .
  ### Phase Five : Learn the encode and decode procedure in the process of input and
            output a certain music of a certain form . 
## Final achievements expected
 The final achievements first of all are expected to be an application of Android system which can input audios , then conduct the audio and finally output it into a headphone device which can give the user an immersing experience horizontally . Then , in the way of using Arduino or other kind of SCM(Single Chip Machine) , we want to wrap our algorithm into a small size of chip to make it portable . That means we can conduct and cope with the signal in a small size of device which can be integrated with the headphone without using the application of the audio player . This headphone will be exactly the product we expect . Then , if all these above are successfully realized , we then want to improve our algorithm and add one more dimension (vertical axis) to make the audio more dimensional .
